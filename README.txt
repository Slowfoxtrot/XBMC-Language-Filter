	    XBMC Language Filter v1.0 release
	    ---------------------------------
		    by Brock Haymond

Welcome to XBMC Language Filter v1.0 public release!  This version is
compatible with the current version of XBMC, Eden 11.0.  It should
continue to be compatible moving forward with any revision of XBMC,
but is not backwards compatible with older versions.

Description
-----------
XBMC Language Filter is a simple perl script creates an edit decision
list, or EDL file, from a subtitles file.  The script can accept any 
given subtitle (SRT) file or a directory of SRT files.  The output is 
an EDL file (or files) that matches the name of the original subtitle
supplied, placed in the same location as the original subtitle file.

The XBMC "MPlayer" EDL file structure that this script outputs is:

[starting time]		[ending time]		[action]
443.78     		445.39     		1

The action to take is "1" for mute.  The "MPlayer" file structure is 
further explained here, along with other supported actions (such as 
removing a scene completely):

only.

How to Use
----------
1.  Make sure your subtitle file and your movie are exactly IN SYNC.
This means that when your subtitles show text, that text is being 
spoken at the exact same time.  If this is not the case, XBMC will 
not be in sync to mute profanity at the right times during the movie.

2.  Run XBMC Language Filter and supply the subtitle file for the 
movie you desire to edit.  For Linux, this is by command line only.  
An EDL file will be produced in the same location as the supplied 
subtitle file.

3.  Move the EDL file that XBMC Language Filter produced into the 
same directory as the movie.

4.  The EDL file and movie have to have the exact same name.  If they 
do not have the SAME NAME and are located in the SAME DIRECTORY, XBMC 
will not find the EDL file when the movie is played and the movie will 
not be edited.

5.  Enjoy your movie edited!


Caution
_______
This project is aimed at editing profanity from movies.  For this 
purpose lists of profane words have been enumerated in files in order 
to define search criteria.  Viewer discretion is advised to these 
lists and should be limited to "must see" only.


Problems?
_________
If you run into any profanities that XBMC Language Filter isn't 
detecting, or for any other problems please email me or submit a bug 
report on github!

One known issue is if the subtitle is in UTF-16 encoding the EDL file 
will be empty when created.  You will need to open the subtitle file 
and save it as UTF-8 and then resubmit it to the filter.

Enjoy!
